# This is the default rcfile of libcwd.
# It will be read when you issue a Debug(read_rcfile());

# Usage:
#
# int main()
# {
#   Debug( libcw_do.on() );
#   Debug( read_rcfile() );

# Turn this on if you don't want detailed RCFILE messages to be printed.
# If you also don't want to see any warnings that this file might produce,
# then don't turn on the debug object before calling Debug(read_rcfile());

# Toggle (turn on) channels matching these masks.
# This must be a comma seperated list of channel label masks
# that will be matched case insensitive against the labels
# of the channels.

# Always turn on the WARNING channel!

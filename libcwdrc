# This is the default rcfile of libcwd.
# It will be read when you issue a Debug(read_rcfile());
# in your program and there is no ./.libcwdrc or $HOME/.libcwdrc.

# Usage:
#
# int main()
# {
#   Debug( libcw_do.on() );
#   Debug( read_rcfile() );

# Note: the recommended way to libcwd is by using gitache and cwds.
# In that case you should put at the top of main what is described
# here: https://github.com/CarloWood/cwds

# Turn this on if you don't want detailed RCFILE messages to be printed.
# If you also don't want to see any warnings that this file might produce,
# then don't turn on the debug object before calling Debug(read_rcfile());

# Turn all channels off by default.

# Toggle (turn on) channels matching these masks.
# This must be a comma seperated list of channel label masks
# that will be matched case insensitive against the labels
# of the channels.
channels_toggle = M*,BFD, n*tice

# Always turn on the WARNING channel!
channels_on = warning

# You can also just give a list

# Alternatively, as example, if your project defines some $REPOROOT/.gdbinit where
# REPOROOT is an environment variable that points to the directory where that file resides,
# you can also do:
#gdb = /usr/bin/gdb -x $REPOROOT/.gdbinit $GDBCOMMANDFILE

# Commandline to execute in order to open a window (for starting gdb at run time).

If you checked out this source tree using CVS
(see http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=354)
then you will need to generate a few files that
are normally included in the release.

In order to generate these files you will need
to have installed the tools `automake', `autoconf'
and `libtool'.

cd into src/libcwd and issue the following commands:

aclocal
autoheader
autoconf
automake

After that, you can continue as usual with
./configure, see the INSTALL file for details.

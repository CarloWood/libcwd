Introduction
------------

Libcwd is for use by developers while still developing: end
applications don't need it.  While still developing, you
will compile with -DDEBUG and link with -lcwd (and add its
install path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH).  A production version is then
simply compiled without -DDEBUG and not linked with -lcwd.

The debug support can be divided into the following components:

1) Support for Object Oriented debug output (using ostream and
   debug objects for `channels' and `devices').
2) Support for memory allocation debugging.

Documentation
-------------

You can find extensive documentation online at
http://libcw.sourceforge.net/debugging/.  There you will find
a reference manual, a tutorial and many examples.

It is highly recommended that you download and install the html
files locally for greater speed.  At the moment you can only
download the documentation by using `cvs':

Install cvs (after all, you are a developer) and issue the
following command once:

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.libcw.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/libcw login

When prompted for a password for anonymous, simply press the
Enter key.  Next download the documentation with the following
commandline:

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.libcw.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/libcw co www

At any later time you can update the documentation by changing
directory into the www directory and issuing:

cvs update

A European mirror has been set up in Amsterdam (the Netherlands)
at http://www.alinoe.com/.  This is my home PC (cable) and
therefore only contains the front page, using www.xs4all.nl
(my other provider) for all the rest of the pages and images.
Feel free to try this when sourceforge is too slow.

Note this documentation includes the documentation of libcw
(without a `d' at the end), libcw is not released to the public
yet.  You can ignore everything not in the debugging/ directory.

libcwd-0.99.2

	Configuration is now automated, using autoconf.  This removes
	the need to install the prototype package.

	The Internal Compiler Error in debugmalloc.cc has been isolated
	and a workaround has been added.  Whether or not the workaround
	is needed is detected by ./configure (but be warned: it depends
	on the CXXFLAGS you use, this bug only occurs when using -ggdb).

	A new function `Debug( check_configuration() )' was added.  Use
	it to assure that the configuration of the linked library matches
	the configuration of the header files used.

	demangle.cc was completely rewritten.  It now exports two functions:
	`demangle_type' and `demangle_symbol', the latter is a replacement
	for the `cplus_demangle' from libiberty.  This allows to link with
	the shared version of libiberty (needed by libbfd) which was needed
	on FreeBSD.  This also gets rid of any direct dependence of libcwd
	on libiberty, which wasn't good because libiberty is not compiled
	with -fPIC.

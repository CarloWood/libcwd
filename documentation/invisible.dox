<hr><h2>Detailed Description</h2>

Allocated memory blocks can be made invisible: They won't show up in
the \ref group_overview "overview of allocated memory" anymore.&nbsp;
Even more, the corresponding \ref libcwd::alloc_ct "alloc_ct" is destroyed:
\ref libcwd::find_alloc "find_alloc" will not find them anymore.&nbsp;
There is no other effect, \ref libcwd::test_delete "test_delete" will still work
and they still can be deleted in the normal way.

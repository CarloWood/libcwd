In order to run the testsuite, you will have to install dejagnu-1.4.1 or higher.
You can download dejagnu from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/dejagnu/.  However, this version
still contains a bug and you'll have to apply the following patch:
edit /usr/share/dejagnu/target.exp line 275 and remove the newline at the end (so that
the word "text" on line 276 is added at the end of line 275:
regsub -all ".*: warning: -f(pic|PIC) ignored for target .*" $text "" text

Alternatively, you can get dejagnu directly from the cvs repository
at http://www.gnu.org/software/dejagnu/ where this bug already has been
fixed (as it will be in any version *after* 1.4.1).


You will also need 'expect' and 'tcl' installed.

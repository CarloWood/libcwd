In order to run the testsuite, you will have to install dejagnu-20000518.

You can download the latest dejagnu from:
ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/dejagnu/

This includes expect and tcl.

In order to compile it, I had to edit the Makefile
after running configure and remove every trace to its
libiberty targets.

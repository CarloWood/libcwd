Quick start
-----------

./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make install

If that doesn't work, mail me: libcw@alinoe.com
(include as much details as possible).

Hackers info
------------

`configure' has a few interesting option.
You can list them by issuing:

./configure --help

There is no reason to `libcwd' feature options
(--disable-libcwd-alloc, --disable-libcwd-magic,
--disable-libcwd-marker and --disable-libcwd-bfd).
Actually, I forgot why they are there :).
You can read more about what they do in Chapter 4
"Debugging compile options" here:
http://libcw.sourceforge.net/templates/index.html?debugging

You can install libcwd in a `staging' directory
by issuing

make DESTDIR=/tmp/staging install

this can come in handy when you want to build an rpm
for instance.

The Makefile has the following targets:

make [all-recursive]
make install
make uninstall
make clean
make distclean

If you feel brave you might even want to try

make dist
make maintainer-clean

well, ... heh.  Look in the Makefile for more targets ;)

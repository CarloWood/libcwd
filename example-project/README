This is a little example project using cwm4 and cwds.

IMPORTANT: This example project only works of you already
           compiled and *installed* libcwd!

Read https://github.com/CarloWood/cwds/blob/master/README.md
for more information on cwm4 and cwds.

Before using this project install those submodules (not
here in libcwd, or you can't compile libcwd anymore;
move example-project somewhere else first and turn it
into a git project by itself).

git submodule add https://github.com/CarloWood/cwm4.git
git submodule add https://github.com/CarloWood/cwds.git
cp cwm4/templates/autogen.sh .
./autogen.sh

And then for example

./configure --enable-maintainer-mode
make
src/helloworld

// sys.h
//
// This header file is included at the top of every source file,
// before any other header file.
// It is intended to add defines that are needed globally and
// to work around Operating System dependend incompatibilities.

// The following includes the libcwd related mandatory part,
// which must be included before any system header file is included!

// Piggy back on cwds.
#include "cwds/sys.h"

// Add project specific parts here.
